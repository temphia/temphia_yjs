# Temphia Yjs
This is a provider for [yjs](https://yjs.dev) to work inside [temphia](https://github.com/temphia/temphia) but underlying provider `EasyProvider` is written in a generic way without making assumption about the transport so it could be used to quickly make adapter provider for transport that donot have official support.

## TODO
- [x] implement awareness
- [x] refactor codemirror example
- [x] export as package
