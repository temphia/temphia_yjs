# ProseMirror Demo
This is a provider for [yjs](https://yjs.dev) to work inside [temphia](https://github.com/temphia/temphia) but underlying provider `EasyProvider` is written in a generic way without making assumption about the transport so it could be used to quickly make adapter provider for transport that donot have official support.

## TODO

- [ ] implement awareness
- [ ] remove codemirror test file.
- [ ] remove not used dependencies and package
